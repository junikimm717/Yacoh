YACOH - Yet another Competitive Programming Helper

This is a bunch of scripts joined together under one unified program to aid the competitive programmer think about his algorithms and less about the setup.

YACOH can do the following:

run - run all tests stored in tests.json (must be run with $PWD = folder)

download - download test cases via competitive companion (listens on port 10046)

create - creates a yacoh folder with a preconfigured template (-cpp for c++ template, -java for a java template. Check the repo for more details on how to configure.)

setup - adds the yacoh script to your $PATH. default shell it modifies is bash, but you change it by doing "yacoh setup zsh"

h - opens up this page
